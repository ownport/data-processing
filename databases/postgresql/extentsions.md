- citusdata/cstore_fdw, https://github.com/citusdata/cstore_fdw. Cstore_fdw is an open source columnar store extension for PostgreSQL. Columnar stores provide notable benefits for analytics use cases where data is loaded in batches. Cstore_fdwâ€™s columnar nature delivers performance by only reading relevant data from disk, and it may compress data 6x-10x to reduce space requirements for data archival.
